Hi, 

I have used cloudformation for this assignment.

I have created a VPC stack to create all my subnets and availability zones. and security groups

After that I have created an Load Balancer stack. I had to create a self signed SSL/TLS certificate. 
I used cloudflare for the same and imported that. The redirection of http requests to https requests 
has been done in this stack

On top of that I have created an Autoscaling stack that launches instances in different availability 
zones. I have used an Apache server ec2 instance and then created an image of that instance that is being 
used as a reference to launch instances

Services used : AWS Cloudformation, Certificate Manager, EC2, VPC, Cloudflare

To improve the project I would have liked to set up a NAT gateway to help
my private subnets interact with the internet using the public subnets. Since
I am absolutely new to these AWS services, I would have liked to explore 
other services better like route 53 to setup my domain and request ssl cert 
from AWS Certified Authority as the cloudflare one was easy to set up but 
kept throwing error when trying to import.
